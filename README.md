## Description
This game is played with two players on a single tab, but you can just play against yourself. Here are the rules.

- A dice is rolled and that number is added to your turn's score, you can decide to roll again or end your turn. 
- If you end your turn, the points you mustered this turn is added to your total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.
- You can keep rolling the dice instead of ending your turn, this will allow you to add points to your turn's score, but you risk rolling a one, which will cause you to lose all your turn's points and your turn will end.
- The first player to 100 points wins.

This is truly an exciting game of chance, have fun!
